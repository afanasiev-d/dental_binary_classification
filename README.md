# dental_binary_classification

here presented the model of binary classification for teeth that can predict if they are Anterior ot Posterior. The detailed program with comments and Explanetion of all processes and ideas you can find in Jupyter Notebook https://github.com/afanasiev-d/dental_binary_classification/blob/main/Dental_Classification_with_Documentation_and_Explanetion.ipynb. 

The expected output of the model that was developed will be saves in .h5 format. The last 2 parts of Notebook (5 and 6 respectively) show a result of training model, it`s performace and analysis. Also there you can find an analysis with detailed conclusion and my ideas about development process
